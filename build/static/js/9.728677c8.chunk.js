My research revolves around optimizations of performance and energy consumption in DL frameworks and compilers such as TVM, as well as resource management for Deep Learning in compute clusters. I have experience in full-stack software development both in teams and freelance, using a range of languages and technologies, including several projects for clients such as Siemens UK/National Rail, where I have built bespoke full-stack solutions starting at back-end storage design, automatic AI/Deep Learning-based predictions and insights, performance optimization, network connectivity and front-end visualisation. My strongest expertise revolves around high-performance integration of various technologies at different levels of the stack to achieve tight cost/time constraints.\n\n# I like\n- Swimming\n- Gym\n- Inline Skating\n- Snooker\n- Video Games\n\n# Travel / Geography\n- I am from originally from a small village in South-East Poland.
